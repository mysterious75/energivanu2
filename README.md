  <strong>Open-source ML toolkit for GPU data center power optimization.</strong>
</p>

**Energivanu** is an open-source machine learning toolkit for GPU data center power optimization, validated at node-level scale with mathematical projections toward larger facility deployments. It predicts high-frequency power spikes, manages battery energy storage system (BESS) dispatch, and staggers distributed AI training phases to reduce peak demand charges and smooth utility grid loads.

Designed for AI data centers (colocation, on-prem, or cloud) running training or fine-tuning workloads on NVIDIA H100/A100 clusters.

## 💡 Key Performance Benchmarks

All simulation metrics listed below are fully reproducible out-of-the-box. Run `python verify_claims.py` to regenerate the baseline reports.

### 📊 Verification Metrics (Out-of-the-Box Demo Model)
*   **BESS Battery Grid Smoothing**: **30.0%** reduction in standard deviation (verified via [MPCController](file:///D:/hacker/energivanu/src/energivanu/mpc.py#L36) on a 30-step sinusoidal trace).
*   **Peak Demand Reduction**: **10.5%** peak load reduction (verified via [PeakShavingOptimizer](file:///D:/hacker/energivanu/src/energivanu/optimizer.py#L25) on a 24-hour TOU profile).
*   **Phase Volatility Reduction**: **59.0%** standard deviation reduction (verified via [PhaseStaggeringScheduler](file:///D:/hacker/energivanu/src/energivanu/scheduler.py#L21) coordinating 4 GPU clusters).
*   **ONNX Inference Speedup**: **~10.0x speedup** on CPU vs PyTorch (verified via ONNX runtime serialization; speedup is hardware-dependent. Run `verify_claims.py` to benchmark in your local environment).
*   **Demo Model Power Prediction**: **4.85% MAPE** validation loss (trained on synthetic data and packaged in `models/checkpoints/best_model_demo.pt`).

### 🔬 Real-Data Benchmarks (York University H100 Workloads)
*   **Real Model Power Prediction**: **1.85% MAPE** best validation loss (achieved on a 15% holdout split of 10,800 H100 sequences).
*   *Note: Due to CC BY-NC-ND data restrictions, the real-data checkpoint is not distributed. To reproduce this metric, download the York dataset and run `python -m energivanu.train_real`.*

> ⚠️ **Scale & Validation Disclaimer:** 
> * **Synthetic Demonstrations**: BESS grid smoothing (30.0%), peak demand shaving (10.5%), and phase-staggering scheduling (59.0%) metrics are verified against synthetic load traces and scheduled offsets. They have not been validated against real, high-frequency facility-scale telemetry.
> * **Single-Node Telemetry**: The 1.85% MAPE prediction error is the only metric evaluated on real GPU telemetry data, which was measured on a single 8-GPU H100 node (York University workload dataset).
> * **No Real BESS Hardware**: All battery dispatch results are simulation-based. No connection to physical BESS hardware, BMS, or PCS has been tested.
> * **No Live Grid Integration**: No integration with real-time grid signals (OpenADR, SCED, or utility APIs). PCLR dispatchability has not been demonstrated in production.
> * **No DCGM Telemetry Pipeline**: All results use CSV-based offline telemetry. Live NVIDIA DCGM ingestion is not yet implemented.
> * **Extrapolation Limits**: Scaling any of these results to a 100K+ GPU facility footprint is a mathematical projection and has not been empirically verified in a live production environment.

## 📚 Related Work & Positioning

Energivanu does not claim to be the first or only project in GPU data center power optimization. Here is where it fits in the existing landscape:

| Project | Focus | Layer | License | Relation to Energivanu |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|----------------------|
| **Zeus** (ml-energy/zeus) | GPU-level energy measurement, power capping, batch size optimization | Single GPU | Apache 2.0 | Complementary — Zeus optimizes per-GPU energy; Energivanu targets cluster-level power shaping |
| **GridPilot** (EPFL) | Grid-responsive GPU power control with fast AGC/FFR response | Cluster | Research | Related — validated on real V100s, focuses on grid signal response rather than BESS |
| **OpenG2G** (SymbioticLab) | GPU-to-grid simulation platform | Grid | Research | Adjacent — grid-level focus, research-stage |
| **PyBaMM** | Physics-based battery modeling and simulation | Battery | MIT | Complementary — could validate Energivanu's BESS degradation model |
| **SustainCluster** (HP) | Sustainable workload scheduling for DC clusters | Facility | Open | Complementary — carbon-aware scheduling, no BESS control |
| **Phaidra** | AI cooling agents (chiller, liquid CDU) | Facility | Proprietary | Complementary — cooling vs power; Phaidra's thermal predictions could pair with Energivanu's power predictions |
| **Emerald AI** | Grid-level workload orchestration (Conductor) | Grid-to-Facility | Proprietary | Complementary — Emerald handles grid signals; Energivanu could serve as micro-execution layer inside the cluster |

**Where Energivanu differs:** The unique combination of (1) TCN+attention power forecasting, (2) native BESS MPC dispatch, and (3) All-Reduce phase staggering in a single open-source package. Individual components exist elsewhere, but this specific integration does not.

**Where we are not:** Energivanu is not a production-ready facility management system, not a PCLR compliance toolkit, and not validated on real BESS hardware.

## 🛠️ Architecture Overview

Energivanu operates on a hierarchical optimization framework, combining machine learning predictions with mathematical programming control:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Telemetry Logs: GPU Power, Temp, Util] --> B[Data Processor: data.py]
    B --> C[EnergivanuPEB: model.py]
    C -->|Regression: Power Forecast| D[MPCController: mpc.py]
    C -->|Classification: Charge/Discharge| D
    D -->|Optimize Trajectory| E[BESS Battery Dispatch]
    F[Cluster Scheduler: scheduler.py] -->|Stagger All-Reduce Phases| G[Aggregate Peak Shaving]
```

### 1. Neural Sequence Prediction
The core ML module [model.py](file:///D:/hacker/energivanu/src/energivanu/model.py) implements [EnergivanuPEB](file:///D:/hacker/energivanu/src/energivanu/model.py#L88), a dual-head model featuring:
*   **Adaptive Domain Normalization**: Dynamic normalizers separating power telemetry from system statistics and cyclical variables.
*   **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)**: Dilated causal convolutions capturing multi-scale receptive fields without future leakage.
*   **Multi-Head Attention**: 8-head self-attention layer analyzing temporal dependencies across the training sequence.
*   **Dual Heads**: Regresses a continuous power forecast over `pred_horizon` steps, while simultaneously classifying BESS dispatch signals (`hold`, `discharge`, `charge`).

### 2. Model Predictive Control (BESS Smoothing)
The [mpc.py](file:///D:/hacker/energivanu/src/energivanu/mpc.py) controller [MPCController](file:///D:/hacker/energivanu/src/energivanu/mpc.py#L36) minimizes grid deviations against a target capacity.
*   **Objective Function**:
    $$\min_{u} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \left[ Q(P_{\text{grid}, k} - P_{\text{target}})^2 + R u_k^2 + S(u_k - u_{k-1})^2 \right]$$
    *Where $u$ is BESS power action, $Q$ penalizes grid deviation, $R$ limits battery wear, and $S$ limits ramp rates.*
*   **Constraints**: Enforces maximum battery charge/discharge limits and maintains State of Charge (SOC) within a safe 5% - 95% buffer.

### 3. Peak Shaving & Time-of-Use Pricing
The [optimizer.py](file:///D:/hacker/energivanu/src/energivanu/optimizer.py) module houses the [PeakShavingOptimizer](file:///D:/hacker/energivanu/src/energivanu/optimizer.py#L25). It uses 15-minute rolling averages (matching utility meters) to calculate peak demand reductions, charging BESS during low-tariff hours and discharging during demand peaks.

### 4. Phase Staggering Scheduler
The [scheduler.py](file:///D:/hacker/energivanu/src/energivanu/scheduler.py) module schedules high-power All-Reduce communication syncs in distributed training. [PhaseStaggeringScheduler](file:///D:/hacker/energivanu/src/energivanu/scheduler.py#L21) calculates phase offsets to prevent clusters from synchronizing simultaneously, reducing aggregated grid volatility by up to 59%.

|--------|---------|----------------|------|----------|
| **Alibaba GPU Trace v2020** | CC BY 4.0 | ✅ Yes | 6,500 | Primary training data |
| **Self-collected T4 data** | Own | ✅ Yes | Variable | Supplement + diversity |
| **Synthetic traces** | N/A | ✅ Yes | N/A | Demo model + testing |
| York University H100 | CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 | ❌ No | 8 | Research only (not distributed) |

### What This Means

- **Distributed demo model** (`best_model_demo.pt`): Trained on synthetic data only. Zero legal risk.
- **Commercial model** (`commercial_best.pt`): Trained on Alibaba CC BY 4.0 + own data. Fully commercial-safe.
- **York/MIT data**: Used only for research and architecture exploration. **Never** included in distributed weights.

### Reproducing Commercial-Safe Training

```bash
# Train on commercial-safe data only
python -m energivanu.train_commercial

# Train with specific sources
python -m energivanu.train_commercial --sources alibaba_gpu_trace kaggle_t4

# Export to ONNX for deployment
python scripts/export_onnx.py --checkpoint models/checkpoints/commercial_best.pt
```
