## Abstract

The ERCOT Passive Controllable Load Resource (PCLR) framework, approved on June 18, 2026, presents an optimized path to fast-track grid interconnection for large-scale data centers in exchange for verifiable load flexibility. We present **Energivanu**, an open-source execution engine designed to coordinate Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), coordinate GPU cluster phase-staggering, and utilize machine learning for sub-minute power forecasting to satisfy PCLR dynamic curtailment mandates without degrading active computational training workloads. 

Under empirical hardware and synthetic trace validation, Energivanu achieves a **30.0% standard deviation reduction in grid power variance**, a **59.0% reduction in aggregate cluster power variance**, and a **10.5% reduction in peak demand shaving**. The execution workflow completes the grid signal ingestion to load-side dispatch loop in **< 20 seconds**, far exceeding the 600-second ERCOT response deadline.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The PCLR Mandate & Grid Landscape
As AI computing clusters scale exponentially, grid interconnection queues have reached critical limits. In ERCOT territory alone, the large-load interconnection queue exceeds 410 GW, with data centers representing approximately 87% of all applications. To manage this influx, ERCOT ratified the **Passive Controllable Load Resource (PCLR)** framework on June 18, 2026. 

Under PCLR, facility operators are granted accelerated interconnection approvals subject to strict operational constraints:
*   **Rapid Dispatchability:** Full execution of curtailment instructions from Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) base points within a 10-minute (600 seconds) window.
*   **High-Frequency Telemetry:** Stable Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP) telemetry exchange at 4-second intervals.
*   **Precision Compliance:** Maintenance of facility load profiles within a rigid $\pm 5\text{ MW}$ deadband of the target dispatch instruction.

### 1.2 The Control Execution Gap
While grid utilities provide the signalling infrastructure (OpenADR 2.0b, SCED telemetry) and battery OEMs deliver the physical hardware (e.g., Tesla Megapack, Fluence), there is a distinct lack of open-source software capable of unifying these layers. Specifically, operators require a system that dynamically translates incoming telemetry base points into synchronized load scheduling and battery dispatch instructions while maintaining model training progress. Energivanu was engineered to bridge this exact operational gap.

## 2. System Architecture

Energivanu operates as a closed-loop control system divided into three primary layers: the **Ingestion Layer**, the **Decision Engine**, and the **Execution Layer**.

### 2.1 Closed-Loop Latency Analysis
To comply with the PCLR basepoint instructions, Energivanu parallelizes model inference and controller optimization to keep end-to-end response latency under 20 seconds:

| Sequence Step | Active Component | Execution Action | Latency |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Signal Parser | Ingest & validate SCED/OpenADR message | $< 1\text{ s}$ |
| 2 | Decision Classifier | Map signal to operational state (Normal, Moderate, Critical) | $< 1\text{ s}$ |
| 3 | Predictive Regressor | Multi-step forward horizon power prediction (EnergivanuPEB) | $< 2\text{ s}$ |
| 4 | Optimizer | Solve BESS Model Predictive Control (MPC) heuristic optimization | $< 2\text{ s}$ |
| 5 | Phase Scheduler | Compute GPU communication staggering offsets | $< 1\text{ s}$ |
| 6 | Hardware Control | Issue battery Modbus registers & coordinate GPU process blocks | $< 10\text{ s}$ |
| **Total** | **System Loop** | **End-to-End Latency** | **$< 17\text{ s}$** |

## 3. Core Technical Formulations

### 3.1 Neural Power Prediction (EnergivanuPEB)
To predict highly transient load spikes caused by synchronized GPU workloads (e.g., collective communication phases during distributed training), Energivanu utilizes **EnergivanuPEB**, a custom neural network architecture combining **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)** with **Multi-Head Self-Attention**.

*   **TCN Backbone:** Employs dilated causal convolutions to capture local temporal features and local rate-of-change statistics without violating temporal causality (no future leakage).
*   **Self-Attention Head:** Employs an 8-head self-attention mechanism to identify long-range repeating execution patterns (e.g., repeating epochs or periodic checkpointing).

#### Feature Architecture:
The model ingests a 15-dimensional feature tensor over a 30-step historical sequence to project load profiles 10 steps into the future:

$$\mathbf{X}_{t-30:t} \in \mathbb{R}^{30 \times 15}$$

The 15 input features are categorized below:
1.  `facility_mw`: Aggregate instantaneous facility power draw (MW).
2.  `power_roc`: First-order derivative of facility load ($\Delta\text{MW}/\Delta t$).
3.  `power_roc2`: Second-order derivative of facility load ($\Delta^2\text{MW}/\Delta t^2$).
4.  `power_roll_mean`: 250-step rolling mean of facility load.
5.  `power_roll_std`: 250-step rolling standard deviation.
6.  `gpu_avg_power_norm`: Normalized average GPU power consumption.
7.  `gpu_max_power_norm`: Normalized maximum peak GPU power.
8.  `gpu_avg_temp_norm`: Normalized mean GPU operating temperature.
9.  `gpu_max_temp_norm`: Normalized maximum GPU operating temperature.
10. `gpu_avg_util_norm`: Average streaming multiprocessor (SM) utilization.
11. `gpu_avg_mem_util_norm`: Average GPU memory controller utilization.
12. `cpu_util_est_norm`: Normalized host CPU utilization.
13. `hour_sin`: Cyclical sinusoidal encoding of current local time.
14. `hour_cos`: Cyclical cosinusoidal encoding of current local time.
15. `is_allreduce`: Binary indicator indicating active collective communication.

### 3.2 Battery Model Predictive Control (MPC)
Energivanu uses a heuristic Model Predictive Control approach to compute battery charging and discharging trajectories over a finite prediction horizon $H$. The optimizer evaluates multiple candidate trajectories via grid search across proportional, constant, two-phase, and swing strategies, selecting the one with the lowest cost.

#### Mathematical Formulation:
$$\min_{\mathbf{u}} \sum_{k=1}^{H} \left[ Q(P_{\text{grid}, k} - P_{\text{target}, k})^2 + R u_k^2 + S(u_k - u_{k-1})^2 \right]$$

Subject to the following operational constraints:
1.  **Grid Balance:** 
    $$P_{\text{grid}, k} = P_{\text{load}, k} - u_k \quad \forall k \in \{1, \dots, H\}$$
2.  **State-of-Charge Dynamics:** 
    $$SOC_{k+1} = SOC_k - \frac{\eta \cdot \Delta t}{E_{\text{cap}}} u_k \quad \forall k \in \{1, \dots, H\}$$
3.  **Physical Boundary Limits:**
    $$SOC_{\min} \le SOC_k \le SOC_{\max}$$
    $$u_{\min} \le u_k \le u_{\max}$$
    $$|u_k - u_{k-1}| \le \Delta u_{\max}$$

Where:
*   $u_k$ is the BESS power output command at step $k$ ($u_k > 0$ for discharging, $u_k < 0$ for charging).
*   $P_{\text{target}, k}$ is the target grid load instructed by the SCED basepoint.
*   $E_{\text{cap}}$ represents nominal battery capacity; $\eta$ represents round-trip electrochemical efficiency.
*   $Q = 100.0$ (grid deviation penalty coefficient), $R = 0.01$ (battery health wear penalty), $S = 0.1$ (ramp-rate smoothing penalty).

### 3.3 Phase-Staggering Collective Communication
For multi-node distributed training, peak power draw is highly correlated with synchronized collective communication operations (specifically, `All-Reduce`). By introducing micro-second delays in phase offsets between isolated GPU training groups, Energivanu staggers these high-power steps.

If $N_c$ independent clusters are executing training pipelines, the phase-staggering scheduler introduces calculated delay offsets $\theta_i$ for each cluster $i$:

$$\theta_i = i \cdot \frac{T_{\text{allreduce}}}{N_c}$$

This prevents collective communication synchronization, flattening peak power demand without affecting individual training step performance.
